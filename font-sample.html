            Dogecoin and Elon Musk are the ones who bring it, 
            but that's not something that you would want to see at the start, because that's a new type of crypto, 
            that's a new technology that people haven't had a while because they're innovating a bit.

            I think just to say that, my favorite bit is comparing bitcoin to bitcoin for the same reason they would be compared with any other big investment.
